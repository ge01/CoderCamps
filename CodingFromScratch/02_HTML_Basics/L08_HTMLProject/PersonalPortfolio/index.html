      My name is and I'm a <em>DIYer</em> currently coding my way to a
      new tech career as a <em>Full Stack Software Developer</em> through the <b>Coder Camps</b>
      online programming bootcamp.  I enjoy working with digital electronics
      like Transistor Transistor Logic (TTLs) and Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)
      to make stuff.   A while back I took a state diagram for an automated
      carwash and simulated it using TTLs and a PLD.

      <h1>My Background</h1>
      For the last seven years I’ve travelled around the nation doing contract
      work for electronic manufacturing companies.  Below is a list of some of
      the cities I’ve worked and lived in.
      <ul>
        <li>Dallas, Texas</li>
        <li>Cedar Rapids, Iowa</li>
        <li>Cleveland, Ohio</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h1>
      A few years ago, I had a job working with System Debug Engineers for a
      microprocessor company.  I was blown away by their ability to use low level
      assembly to troubleshoot hardware.  Since then, I’ve been slowly learning
      programming from various websites.  Now I’m committed to collaborating with
      others through Coder Camps to spring board my career into Full Stack Development.
